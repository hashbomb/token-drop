# Purpose

Unlocking rewards in $WTA for the early builders and supporters of the Wongta ecosystem, with these rewards being recorded on the Mumbai. The distribution of $WTA tokens is intended to acknowledge their outstanding contributions during the ecosystem's early development. The hard work and support of these early participants have been pivotal to Wongta's success, and we are providing generous rewards as a token of gratitude for their efforts and trust. This reward program will further drive the growth of the Wongta ecosystem, bringing more innovation and opportunities to a broader community.

2. Rewards are exclusively limited to the whitelist, which includes early investors and contributors.
3. This portion of the rewards is derived from the Tokenomics plan, specifically from Strategic Partnerships and Grants.
